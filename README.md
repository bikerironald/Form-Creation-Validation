# Form-Creation-Validation
 
This project demonstrates how to build user input forms and apply validation rules to ensure data accuracy and security. It covers the structure of form elements (such as input fields, buttons, and labels) and implements both client-side and server-side validation techniques. The goal is to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining the integrity of the collected data.
